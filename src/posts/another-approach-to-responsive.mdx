## Finding a bridge between JS and CSS

Last year, one of the features I had to code implied listening for resize event and guessing which format the user would be on.

The first solution I came up with was to build a React hook that would listen for `resize` and trigger a state change whenever the window reached a bunch of specified dimensions.

I have been using this solution since I started doing front-end development. But it has always bugged me since even when throttled, the `resize` method over solicitate its callback method.
I wanted to fin another way of dealing with this and that's when our integrator came to me with a CSS solution.

He told that me that `css` is way more efficient than javascript when it comes to listeening on the user screen format.

His solution would be to trigger a css update on a pseudo element content using classical predefined media-queries.
