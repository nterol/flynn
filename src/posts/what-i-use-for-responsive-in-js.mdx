## Finding a bridge between JS and CSS

Last year, one of the features I had to implement a popin component that would behave differently and display different data on mobile and desktop. It also had to adapt to resize event. 

The first solution I came up with was to build a hook that would listen for `resize` and trigger a state change whenever the window reached a bunch of specified dimensions.

  I have been using this solution since I started doing front-end development. 
But it has always bugged me since even when throttled, the `resize` method over solicitate its callback method.
I wanted to fin another way of dealing with this and that's when our integrator came to me with a CSS solution.

He told that me that `css` is way more efficient than javascript when it comes to listening on the user screen format.

His solution would be to trigger a css update on a pseudo element's content using classical predefined media-queries.

Like this : 

<ResponsiveWithCSS />

I thought using css was neat, but in my case I needed to retrieve this information in my React Components. 

After a bit of research I found this amazing method : `window.matchMedia`. 
Tweaking it here and there I ended up building a simple React hook listening different instances of this method. 
It is a bit overkill since cases where one needs to listen to more than one media query are very edgy. 
But it works fine and I have been using it 


<ResponsiveWithJS />
