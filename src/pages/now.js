        Hey ! This is my now Page. I discovered it on Maggie Appleton's website
        and thought it was pretty cool. So these are the things I am doing now:
        <ul>
          <li>- Learning about Tarot. </li>
          <li>- Learning about Gatsby</li>
        </ul>
      </main>
    </Layout>
  )
}

export default NowPage
